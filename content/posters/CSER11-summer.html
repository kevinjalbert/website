<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  The proposed technique uses static source code metrics to predict the difficulty of detecting bugs within a source code unit. We use mutation testing with mature test suites to estimate how difficult it is to find a bug within the observed source code unit. The estimated difficulty of detecting a bug can be used to train a support vector machine with a feature set of source code metrics. After sufficient training it becomes possible to predict how difficult bugs are to detect using only source code metrics of the observed source code unit. Preliminary results in classifying the difficulty of detecting a bug using only a single open source project had a cross validation accuracy of 76.80%.
