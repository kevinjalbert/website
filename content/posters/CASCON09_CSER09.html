<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  We use known concurrency bugs to help identify future bugs in deployed software by turning them into bug patterns. Clone detection pattern matching and rule evaluation are used to find bug pattern matches. These matches can be used during testing to target specific thread interleavings instead of examining all executions.
