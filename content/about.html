<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>
  I am an easy going guy, who likes to brainstorm up crazy ideas. I typically like to analyze situations to come up with the best solution. Obviously there are scenarios that I do not know what is best to do, which gets my research gears turning in overdrive. In software this trait works much to my advantage because I want to do my best.

<p>
  My passion for all things computer and software started way back in elementary school. Console video games started to arise and I grasped them quickly. Eventually my parents got a basic computer (I believe it was a Pentium) and I began to dabble with that. Sometime not long after that point I had already decided for myself that I would pursue a career that involves programming (originally aiming for game development).

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
  During my high-school years I started to take my growing interest in software programming more seriously. I took all the computer programming courses available and I did some readings at home. Eventually the time for University came, I decided to go to <a href="http://uoit.ca">UOIT - University of Ontario Institute of Technology</a> and completed my B.Eng in Software Engineering in 2010.

<p>
  During the last two years of my undergrad I was engaged in research work with <a href="http://faculty.uoit.ca/bradbury">Jeremy S. Bradbury</a>. My research focus was on software quality and testing of concurrent (multi-threaded) programs. I thoroughly enjoyed doing research, especially in this area. I decided to stick with it and pursue a Masters in Computer Science at UOIT with Jeremy S. Bradbury.

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>
  A lot of my interests fall into the software realm. Some are related to work, and other just for personal reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Linux, specifically <a href="http://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a></li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Android</li>
  <li>Data Mining</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I have a number of interests that lie outside of work. I primarily entertain myself by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading about current technology trends</li>
  <li>Brainstorming and/or hacking projects</li>
  <li>Playing video games</li>
  <li>Playing guitar</li>
  <li>Going out for a run</li>
  <li>Spending time with my amazing girlfriend</li>
</ul>
