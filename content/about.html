<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>
  I am an easy going guy, who likes to brainstorm up crazy ideas. I typically like to analyze situations to come up with the best solution. Obviously there are scenarios that I do not know what is best to do, which gets my research gears turning in overdrive. In software this trait works much to my advantage because I want to do my best.

<p>
  My passion for all things computer and software started way back in elementary school. Console video games started to arise and I grasped them quickly. Eventually my parents got a basic computer (I believe it was a Pentium) and I began to dabble with that. Sometime not long after that point I had already decided for myself that I would pursue a career that involves programming (originally aiming for game development).

<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
  During my high-school years I started to take my growing interest in software programming more seriously. I took all the computer programming courses available and I did some readings at home. Eventually the time for University came, I decided to go to <a href="http://uoit.ca">University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT)</a> and completed my B.Eng in Software Engineering in 2010.
</p>

<p>
  During the last two years of my undergraduate degree I was engaged in research work with <a href="http://faculty.uoit.ca/bradbury">Dr. Jeremy S. Bradbury</a>. My research focus was on software quality and testing of concurrent (multi-threaded) programs. I thoroughly enjoyed doing research, especially in this area. I decided to stick with it and pursue a Masters in Computer Science at UOIT with Dr. Jeremy S. Bradbury.

<p>
  I completed my Master degree on <a href="https://github.com/kevinjalbert/master-thesis">Predicting Mutation Scores using Source Code and Test Suite Metrics</a> at UOIT. I was originally thinking of pursuing a PhD degree after my Masters, but I decided to gain some industry experience first. I might come back to research eventually, but only time will tell.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently working at <a href="http://fixmo.ca">Fixmo</a> as a Software Engineer. At Fixmo I primarily work in front-end development using <a href="https://vaadin.com">Vaadin</a>. In my spare cycles I have introduced and established automated UI testing of our product.

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>
  A lot of my interests fall into the software realm. Some are related to work, and other just for personal reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Data Mining</li>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I have a number of interests that lie outside of work. I primarily entertain myself by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading about current technology trends</li>
  <li>Brainstorming and/or hacking projects</li>
  <li>Playing video games</li>
  <li>Playing guitar</li>
  <li>Going out for a run</li>
  <li>Spending time with my amazing soon-to-be wife</li>
</ul>
